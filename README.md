Hello there! I'm a passionate **C++ developer** and **digital artist** from Russia, with over **5 years of experience** in programming. My journey in the tech and digital art world has been filled with learning, creating, and collaborating.

## ü§ù Connect With Me

If you're curious about **C++** or have any questions, feel free to drop me a message. I'm always eager to help and share my knowledge. However, I'd like to note a few things:

- **Software Sales**: I'm not the right person for inquiries related to software sales. Apologies for any inconvenience!
- **Joining Teams**: Currently, I'm not looking to join new teams or projects. Thanks for your understanding.
- **Friend Requests**: I welcome connections but prefer a bit of context with friend requests. A simple introduction or reason for connecting goes a long way. Requests without context might lead to a decline or block, in an effort to keep my network meaningful.
- **Development Teams**: I'm not available to join any dev teams at this moment.
- **Network Management**: My friends list is curated to include those I've interacted with significantly or know well. If you're removed, it's purely for organizational purposes, not personal.

## üí¨ Conversation Tips

To ensure productive and engaging conversations, please consider the following:

- **Straight to the Point**: Skip the formal "Hi" and dive directly into the topic.
- **Direct Questions**: No need to ask if you can ask; just go for it.
- **Stay Online**: If you message me, try to stay online for a bit, so we can have a real-time conversation.
- **Meaningful Chats**: Let's keep our exchanges coherent and purposeful.

Developing cheats isn't about WHY. It's about WHY NOT. Why cheat development is so bad? Why not marry good programs if you love them so much. In fact, why not develop a special safety door that won't hit you on the butt on the way out, because you are banned!
